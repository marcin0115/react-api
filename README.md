# WeatherApp react-api

WeatherApp created in React (by API).
The apllication allows you to check the weather in many cities around the world.
In the input, we enter the city we are looking for. If the city is in the base we get information about the current weather conditions in this city.
The search is done online.

The apllication consists of main component App.js (stateful functional component) and two stateless functional components: Form.js and Result.js.
In App.js are located two methods: componentDidUpdate() and fetch(). Their role is to query the API and update the data.
Each change in input causes a request to be send to the API.
